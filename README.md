## Work with Elasticsearch PHP client

### Connecting 
Refer to the [Connecting section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_connecting)
of the getting started documentation.

### Usage
The `elasticsearch-php` client offers 400+ endpoints for interacting with
Elasticsearch. A list of all these endpoints is available in the
[official documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html)
of Elasticsearch APIs.

Here we reported the basic operation that you can perform with the client:
index, search and delete.
- [Creating an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_creating_an_index)
- [Indexing a document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_indexing_documents)
- [Getting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_getting_documents)
- [Searching documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/getting-started-php.html#_searching_documents)
